= Modelling a recommendation engine: A worked example

This is the repository behind a Neo4j meetup talk demonstrating how to incrementally model a real time recommendation engine.

If you're in London feel free to come along, you can link:http://www.meetup.com/graphdb-london/events/226721630/[register on meetup.com]

== Downloading & configuring Neo4j

The following instructions assume that you're using Neo4j 2.3.1 so go and link:http://neo4j.com/download/[download that now] if you haven't already

Once you've done that you'll need to add the following in `neo4j.properties`

[source, text]
----
dbms.security.load_csv_file_url_root=data/import
----

If you're using the Desktop installer set that to an absolute path rather than a relative one e.g.

[source, text]
----
dbms.security.load_csv_file_url_root=/Users/markneedham/projects/meetups/modeling-worked-example/data/
----

After you've done that copy the CSV files from the `data` folder to that location e.g.

[source, text]
----
cp data/*.csv neo4j-community-2.3.1/data/import/
----

== Importing the data

The Cypher `LOAD CSV` scripts are in the `cypher` folder of the repository.
You can execute them individually or use the `import.sh` script.

[source, bash]
----
./import.sh
----

Now you're all set to follow along with the session.

== Queries

The following are the queries that we will write during the session:

include::docs/queries.adoc[]

== Downloading the raw data

If you want to download the raw data you'll need to first get a link:https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/[meetup API key].
Once you've got that create a file `key` with the following content:

[source, text]
----
export MEETUP_API_KEY="<your-api-key>"
----

Once you've done that you can run the following script:

[source, bash]
----
./download.sh
----
